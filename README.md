# Homework2

The Tasks are ...
1. Create a container image thatâ€™s has Jenkins installed using Dockerfile. 

2. When we launch this image, it should automatically start the Jenkins service in the container.

3. Create a job chain of job1, job2, job3 and job4 using the build pipeline plugin in Jenkins.

4. Job1: Pull the GitHub repo automatically when some developers push the repo to GitHub.

5. Job2: By looking at the code or program file, Jenkins should automatically start the respective language interpreter install image container to deploy code ( eg. If code is of PHP, then Jenkins should start the container that has PHP already installed ).

6. Job3: Test your app if it is working or not.

7. Job4: If the app is not working, then send an email to the developer with error messages.

8. Create One extra job job5 for monitor: If the container where the app is running. fails due to any reason then this job should automatically start the container again.
